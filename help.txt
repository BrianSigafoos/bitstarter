In previous homeworks, we have setup develop, staging and master branches of bitstarter. We have also deployed our stating and production app to heroku. I'd like to continue the work of HW7 in my bitstarter repository rather than start over from bitstarter-ssjs-db. Therefore I can develop in develop branch, testing in staging app etc. And I did so. If anyone has the same sentiment, below instructions may help.


We need to download bitstarter-ssjs-db first:

 git clone https://github.com/startup-class/bitstarter-ssjs-db.git


Then cd to bitstarter, switch to develop branch

 cd ~/bitstarter
 git checkout develop


Copy neccesary files from bitstarter-ssjs-db

 cp -avr ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/models ./models
 cp -avr ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/views ./views
 cp ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/.env.dummy .env
 cp ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/.gitignore .gitignore
 cp ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/.pgpass .pgpass
 cp ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/package.json ./package.json
 cp ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/pgsetup.sh ./pgsetup.sh
 cp ../bitstarter-ssjs-db/web.js ./web.js


Modify index.html to add "Orders" link


install npm packages

 sudo npm install


Now we are going to setup heroku addons. Because we have created at least two heroku apps (staging and production) from previous homework, we need to get heroku apps we have created by below command

 heroku apps


Then setup heroku addons, please note that we need to specify app name which we got from preceded step.

 heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev --app YOUR-STAGING-APP-NAME
 heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev --app YOUR-PRODUCTION-APP-NAME

 heroku pg:promote `heroku config --app YOUR-STAGING-APP-NAME  | grep HEROKU_POSTGRESQL | cut -f1 -d':'` --app YOUR-STAGING-APP-NAME
 heroku pg:promote `heroku config --app YOUR-PRODUCTION-APP-NAME  | grep HEROKU_POSTGRESQL | cut -f1 -d':'` --app YOUR-PRODUCTION-APP-NAME

 heroku plugins:install git://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config.git


Now we are going to setup postgresql. Please note that when it prompts you to "INPUT THE FOLLOWING PASSWORD TWICE BELOW", just input "bitpass0" as it prompts. DO NOT modify password here.

 ./pgsetup.sh


Modify .env to provide your coinbase API key



Now we are set to run this app locally

foreman start


Browse the app in browser, if everything is OK. Then commit changes and push develop branch to origin repostory of github as we learnt before.


Then switch to staging branch, merge changes from develop branch. Deploy to heroku staging app we have created before.


After deployed to heroku, we need to push .env to the remote server with below command to prevent "Invalid api key"

heroku config:push --app YOUR-STAGING-APP-NAME


Test the staging app from browser. If everything runs as expected. Push staging branch to origin repository of github.


Then switch to master branch repeat to merge, deploy to heroku, push .env and push to github.
If everything goes well, now we can see the Orders link from our production heroku app as I did here: http://inecklace.net/.
